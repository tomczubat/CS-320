# CS-320 Software Test, Automation& QA

There are many lessons that I have learned in this course about software testing. I learned that I need to make sure my software is functional and secure. This comes from knowing what test cases I need to create to ensure that I am meeting the reqreuiements of the client. Paying attention to the test coverage percentage is also something that reminded me to go back and make my tests better. Paying attention to the user needs was one of the most important lessons that I learned. Being able to take information from a user and trsnalating this into test cases is a very important skill that I have worked on during this semester. These requirements are vital because they will tell you if your software is doing what its supposed to do. The satisfaction of the client is the most important aspect of developing software so having good communication skills is important in this area. I believe that I will approach software design differently now that I have learned about testing. I will emphasize requirements. I will also plan and think ahead about what pieces of data I will need in my software. I will also consider what pieces of data the suer will need to have access to while they use my sofrware. I also think that testing needs to be an ongong process during software development and not an afterthought because poor testing procedures can cause sofware defects to not be found and the company could lose a lot of money.
